Introduction: 
1. Python is a high-level programming language 
2. It is open source, interpreted, objected-oriented programming language 
3. The first version was released on February 20, 1991 
4. Python langugage is easy to learn and use as it is close to human language 
5. It has been used to develop web applications, desktop applications, system adminstration, and machine learning libraries 
6. Python is highly embraced language in the data science and machine learning community 

Python Shell:
1. Python is an interpreted scripting language, so it does not need to be compiled. It means it executes the code line by line
2. Python comes with a Python Shell (Python Interactive Shell). It is used to execute a single python command and get the result 

Debugging:

4. Python will give you results if you write scripts that Python understands, if not it returns errors
5. The process of identifying and removing errors from a program is called debugging
6. Some of the Python errors you may encounter are SyntaxError, IndexError, NameError, ModuleNotFoundError, KeyError, ImportError, AttributeError, TypeError, ValueError, ZeroDivisionError etc. 

Comment:

7. A comment is a part of the code which is not executed by python. So we can leave some text in our code to make our code more readable
8. A comment in python starts with hash(#) symbol
9. Single line comment example: # This is the first comment 
10. Multiple line comment example: """This is multiline comment \
multiline comment takes multiple lines."""

Syntax: 

9. A Python script can be written in Python interactive shell or in the code editor
10. A Python file has an extension .py.

Indentation:

11. An indentation is a white space in a text. Indentation in many languages is used to increase code readability, however Python uses indentation to create block of codes
12. In other programming languages curly brackets are used to create blocks of codes instead of indentation
13. One of the common bugs when writing python code is wrong indentation.

Data types: 

14. Number: 

  a. Integer: Integer(negative, zero and positive) numbers Example: ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ... \
  b. Float: Decimal number Example ... -3.5, -2.25, -1.0, 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.5 ... \
  c.Complex Example 1 + j, 2 + 4j
 
 15. String: 
 
 a. A collection of one or more characters under a single or double quote. If a string is more than one sentence then we use a triple quote.\
 b. example: 'Mahadev' 'Myself Deepak' 
 
 16. Booleans: A boolean data type is either a True or False value. T and F should be always uppercase.

17. List: 

a. Python list is an ordered collection which allows to store different data type items. A list is similar to an array in JavaScript\
b. Example: \
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # all are the same data types - a list of numbers\
['Banana', 'Orange', 'Mango', 'Avocado'] # all the same data types - a list of strings (fruits)\
['Finland','Estonia', 'Sweden','Norway'] # all the same data types - a list of strings (countries)\
['Banana', 10, False, 9.81] # different data types in the list - string, integer, boolean and float\

18.Dictionary:

a. A Python dictionary object is an unordered collection of data in a key value pair format. \
b. Example: \
{'name':'Deepak', 'age':'32', 'skills':['Python']}

19. Tuple:

a. A tuple is an ordered collection of different data types like list but tuples can not be modified once they are created \
b. They are immutable \
c. example: ('Earth', 'Jupiter', 'Neptune', 'Mars', 'Venus', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Mercury') # planets

20. Set:

a. A set is a collection of data types similar to list and tuple, but not an ordered collection of items\
b. set in Python stores only unique items\
c. Example: {2, 4, 3, 5}

21. Checking Data types: To check the data type of certain data/variable we use the type function

Example: \
a. type(10) returns <class 'int'>\
b. type(3.14) returns <class 'float'>
